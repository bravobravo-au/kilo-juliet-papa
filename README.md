Control Raspberry Pi Outputs via MQTT

This python project can control Raspberry Pi GPIO Output pins as a result of receiving MQTT messages and also take GPIO inputs and deliver their status via MQTT. So a MQTT to GPIO bridge. Configuration is supplied via INI file and this allows one MQTT topic to be assigned to one GPIO. There is also the ability to configure how the software should decode the MQTT message to control the GPIO output.

At the moment the idea is to keep this fairly simple but you never know it might evolve from there as people provide feedback and feature requests.

This project is also able to run any shell command based upon a MQTT message. This is useful for gluing MQTT into unix systems.

#Examples of use
1. Driving hardware outputs such as relays. The other users this to drive a door solenoid and magnetic door holder and have his home automation system publish MQTT messages to control the door. 
2. Pushing hardware inputs into MQTT. The author uses this to determine if a door solenoid latch in in the open or closed position.
3. Running commands when a MQTT message is received. The author uses this to have a Raspberry pi shutdown when a MQTT message is receieved. This is useful for a plex setup that is not always on.

If you have more please feel free to share.

#Installation

1. Install the requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Edit your config.ini to your liking

3. Run kilo-juliet-papa

python kilo-juliet-papa.py


command line options
--config 

This specifies a differently named configuration file.

--debug=1
Turn on more verbose debugging


All configuration is supplied by the config.ini file. This means that you should not need to make changes to code to perform basic tasks.

#Sample output configuration

Relay on BCM GPIO 17 with Message of ON or OFF

```[RELAY1]
TYPE=GPIO
GPIO_TYPE=OUTPUT
GPIO_PIN=17
MQTT_TOPIC=STAT/relay1
TOGGLE_MQTT_TOPIC=STAT/relay1-toggle
TOGGLE_MQTT_MESSAGE={"Value":"{VALUE}"}
MQTT_PARSER=JSONINT
MQTT_PARSER_ARG1=Value
LOG_MESSAGE=Setting pin: %(pin)s to value: %(value)s based upon message: %(message)s on MQTT topic: %(topic)s
MQTT_QOS=0
MQTT_RETAIN=True
```
Outputs can listen on two MQTT topics. The main topic takes a value from the message that is published and this is used to set the Raspbery Pi output. The toggle topic will toggle the GPIO output everytime a message of any value is published to this topic.

The toggle mqtt message is the message that is published to MQTT_TOPIC when the output is toggled.

MQTT_PARSER allows different functions to be called to parse the MQTT message and change the output. JSONINT parses a JSON message for an integer assigned to JSON field defined in MQTT_PARSER_ARG1. All non zero values result in the output being High. A zero sets the output LOW. STRONOFF looks for the Strings ON and OFF to turn the output ON and OFF respectively.

LOG_MESSAGE is the string that is posted to the LOG file when this output is triggered.

#Sample input configuration

```[INPUT1]
TYPE=GPIO
GPIO_TYPE=INPUT
GPIO_PIN=2
MQTT_TOPIC=STAT/input1
MQTT_MESSAGE={"Value":"{VALUE}"}
MQTT_QOS=0
MQTT_RETAIN=True
LOG_MESSAGE=Published MQTT Message: %(message)s to topic: %(topic)s
```
MQTT_MESSAGE is the message that is posted to MQTT. {VALUE} is the logic value of the input.

#Sample command configuration

'''[SHUTDOWN]
TYPE=COMMAND
COMMAND=sudo /sbin/shutdown -h now
MQTT_TOPIC=STAT/plex-server/shutdown-now
LOG_MESSAGE=Ran command:%(command)s and got return code:%(returncode)s based upon message:%(message)s on topic:%(topic)s
'''

COMMAND is the command to execute when anything is published to this MQTT topic. 
LOG_MESSAGE is written when the message is processed.

Note: To call shutdown, some changes were made sudoers to allow a non root user to run shutdown via sudo. This is a safer way than running this script as root. At the moment nothing is done with the returned data form the process. Maybe later this could be pushed back to MQTT.

#Why the name?

Well applying the Nato Phonetic Alphabet to the name gives you KJP, which are the initials of the great Singer / Songwriter and guitarist Kelly Joe Phelps https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_Joe_Phelps
